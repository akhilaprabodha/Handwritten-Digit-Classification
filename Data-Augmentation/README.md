## 🌟 Overview

Handwritten digit classification is a classic problem in machine learning and computer vision. This project leverages data augmentation techniques to improve model performance, particularly focusing on rotated images. The MNIST dataset is used as the primary dataset.

## 🔄 Data Augmentation

To improve the robustness and generalization of the model, various data augmentation techniques are applied:

- **🔄 Rotation**: Images are randomly rotated to simulate different orientations.
- **📏 Resizing**: Images are resized to a fixed size.
- **🔄 Tensor Conversion**: Images are converted to tensors for PyTorch processing.

## 🧠 Model Training

The training process involves the following steps:

1. **📥 Loading the Dataset**: The MNIST dataset is loaded with and without rotation.
2. **🔄 Transformations**: Defined transformations are applied to the training and validation datasets.
3. **🏋️‍♂️ Training the Model**: A neural network is trained on the augmented dataset.
4. **💾 Saving the Model**: The trained model is saved for evaluation and inference.

## 📊 Evaluation

The model is evaluated using a rotated test dataset. Key metrics such as accuracy and loss are tracked and plotted.

## 📈 Results

- **📉 Accuracy and Loss Graphs**: Plots showing the training progress.
- **❌ Misclassified Samples**: Visual representation of misclassified digits to analyze model performance.
