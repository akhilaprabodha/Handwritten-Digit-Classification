## 📁 Project Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for building and training an autoencoder to denoise digit images, followed by a classifier to identify the digits. The main components are:

1. **Autoencoder**: A neural network trained to remove noise from images. 🌟
2. **Classifier**: A neural network trained to classify the denoised digit images. 🔢

## 📜 Features

- **Noise Removal**: The autoencoder efficiently removes noise from input images, enhancing the clarity and quality of digit representations. 🧼
- **Digit Classification**: Accurate classification of digits (0-9) using a convolutional neural network (CNN). 🔍
- **Dataset**: Uses the MNIST dataset for training and evaluation. 🗂️

## 🛠️ Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akhilaprabodha/Handwritten-Digit-Classification/tree/main/Denoising-AutoEncoder.git
cd digit-classification-denoising-autoencoder
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage

Follow these steps to train the autoencoder and classifier:

1. **Prepare the Data**: Load the MNIST dataset and add noise to the digit images.
2. **Train the Autoencoder**: Train the autoencoder to learn how to remove noise from the images.
3. **Train the Classifier**: Use the denoised images to train the classifier.
4. **Evaluate**: Evaluate the performance of the classifier on the test set.

Run the Jupyter notebook `Build an Autoencoder.ipynb` to see the full process in action. 📓

## 📊 Results

The autoencoder successfully reduces noise in the digit images, leading to improved classification accuracy. Below are some examples of noisy images, denoised images, and their corresponding classifications.
